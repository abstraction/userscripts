# Userscripts

This repository serves as my personal archive for userscripts. Userscripts are JavaScript programs designed to modify web pages. They run in web browsers through a userscript manager (e.g., [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)).

Feel free to explore the scripts I've collected and created by visiting [this directory](./src/).
